# Concurrency Anomalies in Applications

This repository serves as a sample project to demonstrate various concurrency anomalies in 
applications and how to handle them effectively using different concurrency control mechanisms. 

It accompanies the blog post [Addressing Concurrency Anomalies in Applications](https://www.gastonotero.com/blog/addressing-concurrency-anomalies-in-applications/), 
where these concepts are explored in depth.

In a minor scale, this also touches some concepts which can be clarified in this other blog post, 
[DDD, CQRS and Distributed Systems in Python](https://www.gastonotero.com/blog/ddd-cqrs-distributed-systems/).

## Overview

The project provides:

- Examples of **dirty reads, non-repeatable reads, and lost updates** in a transactional system.
- Implementations of **pessimistic and optimistic concurrency control** strategies.
- A **Domain-Driven Design (DDD) approach** to managing concurrency without depending on particular implementations.

## Contributing

Feel free to open issues or submit pull requests if you find improvements or want to extend the examples.
